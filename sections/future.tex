\section{Future Scope of Work}\label{section-future-scope}
Section \ref{subsection-processing-bios} so far covered only a framework with single module only to back the proposed work with the \gls{poc}. 
However the next phase of the existing work will include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Study of existing hotspots for automation
	\item Analyzing and gathering requirements of automation to hotspot
	\item Implementing and managing platform to keep up-to-date the user base of the framework
\end{itemize}

The study also shows the redundant implementation definition of codebase and structure under various different platform architecture and components. Thus the another possible scope of can be the implementation of a reinforcement algorithm to perform optimizing the redundant codebase across all the platforms by maintaining the integrity and security as per \gls{csme} guideline.
