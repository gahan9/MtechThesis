\section{Future Scope of Work}\label{section-future-scope}
Few implementation modules of Section \ref{section-proposed-work} are not well developed at production launch which a slight modification and standard checks have to be performed to make the modules qualify for production level. Also as the release of production other stuff to be maintained is user guide, FAQs and other "how-to" articles to help out others to ease in using the framework.

Along with the enhancing of existing modules there will still be exercise to analyze existing system to explore more use cases which are taking a longer time for every build iteration for the system.

Few of the possible use cases to study and decide the feasibility of implementation would be:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Development and testing of individual driver component rather than building the whole BIOS image
	\item AI powered Search Engine to enhance the findings of FAQs for relevant existing queries and articles
	\item Automating the initial BIOS Environment Setup
	\item Platform independent easy installation setup for the framework
\end{itemize}
