Intel System on a Chip (\gls{soc}) features a new set of Intel Intellectual Property (\gls{ip}) for every generation. \gls{bios} involves development of major individual components such as Processor, Graphics/Memory Controller, Input/Output Controller hub, System Monitor/Management Bus, Direct Media Interface, SATA/IDE/USB, Peripheral Component Interconnect (\gls{pci}), Voltage Regulator and Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (\gls{acpi}) for every Intel System on a Chip (\gls{soc}). Duration of every iteration of the development of any such components takes a much longer duration to build the BIOS binary and executing on hardware/\gls{soc} and verifying the functional work flow from logs. Even for some minor changes such as changing setup option value takes a high amount of time for iteration which is indeed slowing down the process of release and development of the Intel Intellectual Property (\gls{ip}). Major aim of this project will be to introduce a framework which can be used to reduce the cost of each build and test iteration for product development.
