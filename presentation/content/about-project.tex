\begin{frame}{About the Project}
    In general to generate BIOS image (*.rom file), compilation of XYZ.c (source code) has to be done, this compilation not only involves compilation of DXE driver, PEI driver, EFI Application but also includes pre-processing checks, compression of raw files which takes huge amount of time depending on the system configuration.
    
    Implementation of this project aids in reduction of this compilation time.
