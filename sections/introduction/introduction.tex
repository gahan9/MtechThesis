\section{Introduction}\label{section-introduction}
Intel System on a Chip (\gls{soc}) features a new set of Intel Uncore Intellectual Property (IP) for every generation.
Section \ref{section-introduction} covers the introduction and overview of BIOS, UEFI and it's role and major components - Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (\gls{acpi}), Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (\gls{pcie}) and Graphics Controller. Section \ref{section-design} describes the design of UEFI and the boot phases in detail. The study of the BIOS binary structure and mapping of each components byte and alignment is described in Section \ref{section-architecture}. Proposed work to reducing the process of build iteration described in Section \ref{section-proposed-work}. 

\subsection{Uncore \gls{ip}}
The Uncore encompasses system agent (SA), memory and Uncore agents such as graphics controller, display controller, memory controller and Input Output (IO).The Uncore IPs are Peripheral Component Interface Express (PCIe), Graphics Processing Engine (GPE), Thunderbolt, Imaging Processing Agent (IPU), North Peak (NPK), Virtualization Technology for directed-IO (Vt-d), Volume Management Device (VMD).

PCI Express abbreviated as \gls{pci} or \gls{pcie}, is designed to replace the older PCI standards. A data communicating system is highly-developed via PCIe for use the transfer data between the host and the peripheral devices. Intel developed the hardware interface which allows the connection of external peripherals to a computer called Thunderbolt. This interface not only has PCI Express (PCIe) and DisplayPort (DP) combined into two serial signals but additionally provides DC power also, bundled in just one cable.
\say{Graphics Processing Engine (GPE)}, \say{Integrated graphics}, \say{shared graphics solutions}, \say{integrated graphics processors (IGP)} or \say{unified memory architecture(UMA)} utilize a portion of a memory of computer system instead of having dedicated graphics memory.
GPEs can be integrated onto the motherboard as part of the chipset. Guest virtual machines use Virtual Technology for Directed-IO (Vt-d), an input/output memory management unit(IOMMU), to directly use peripheral devices, such as hard-drive controllers, accelerated graphics cards and Ethernet, through interrupt remapping.

\subsection{Legacy \gls{bios} and \gls{uefi}}

\paragraph{\gls{bios}} is the governing reference which specifies a firmware interface.

"Legacy" (as in Legacy \gls{bios}) -  in terms of firmware specifications it refers to an older, broadly used specification. Major responsibility of \gls{bios} is to initialize the hardware devices, loading and commencing an \gls{os}. When the system boots, the BIOS initializes and identifies every connected system devices including keyboard, mouse, hard disk drive, solid state drive, video display card and other hardware followed by locating software stored on a boot device i.e. a hard disk or removable storage such as USB or CD/DVD and loads and executes that software, transferring control of the system to it. This flow of actions is also known as "booting" or "boot strapping".

\subsubsection{Background of Legacy \gls{bios}}
In 1980s, IBM developed the personal computer with a 16-bit BIOS with the aim of ending the BIOS after the first 250,000 products. Legacy BIOS is based upon Intel’s original 16-bit architecture, ordinarily referred to as "8086" architecture. And as technology advanced, Intel extended that 8086 architecture from 16 to 32-bit. Legacy BIOS is able to run different \gls{os} very well irrespective if the system is IBM or not. Additionally, Legacy BIOS also has a defined OS-independent interface for hardware that enables interrupts to communicate with keyboard, disk and video services along with the BIOS ROM loader and bootstrap loader, to name a few.

Use of legacy BIOS is diminishing and is expected to be phased out in new systems by the year 2020.

\subsubsection{Limitations of legacy BIOS}
With progress in technologies, the BIOS implementations were also updated with many new configuration and power management technologies and added support for many generations of Intel® architecture hardware. Although a few of limitations namely, upper memory block (UMB) dependencies, PC AT hardware dependencies, 1 MB addressable space and 16-bit addressing mode persisted throughout the years. The need to integrate libraries of third-party firmware modules into a single platform solution across multiple product lines and ensuring quality of individual firmware modules arises in the industries. The existing market demands to overcome inherent limitations lead towards development of a fresh BIOS architecture which is introduced in market as The UEFI specifications.

One major problem with existing BIOS implementations is that since they are highly customized for a specific motherboard, there maintenance is difficult. A lot of effort is required in significant porting, integration, testing and debug work of changes in component modules. The UEFI architecture is designed to considering these limitations and to resolve them.


\subsection{Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (\gls{uefi})}
\gls{uefi} is a replacement for legacy BIOS to act as the interface between a operating system and its platform firmware streamlining the booting process. It offers a rich extensible pre-OS environment with advanced boot and runtime services, replacing most BIOS functions. Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is grounded in Intel’s initial Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) specification 1.10, which defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It has intrinsic networking capabilities,  is designed to work with multi-processors (MP) system and also allows users to execute applications on a command line interface.

\end{figure}

The UEFI Forum board of directors consists of representatives from 11 industry leaders as described in Figure \ref{fig:introduction-uefi-board-of-directors}. These organizations work to ensure that the UEFI specifications meet industry needs.

UEFI uses a different interface for runtime services and boot services but UEFI does not specify how "Power On Self Test" (POST) and Setup are implemented those are BIOS’ primary functions.

\subsubsection{\gls{uefi} Driver Model Extension}
Boot devices are accessible via a set of protocol interfaces. The UEFI Driver Model provides a replacement for PC-AT-style option ROMs.

The UEFI Driver Model was not designed to replace the high-performance OS specific drivers but to access boot devices in the pre-boot environment, to support the execution of modular pieces of code, also known as drivers.These drivers control hardware buses and devices on the platform, and also they may provide some software-derived, platform specific service. The information required by the driver developers for implementing combination of bus drivers which boot an UEFI-complaint OS are included in the UEFI Driver Model.

Thus the UEFI Driver Model is designed to be generic.The UEFI Specification describes how to write USB bus drivers, USB device drivers, PCI device drivers, PCI bus drivers and SCSI drivers.
Additional details are provided that allow UEFI drivers to be stored in PCI option ROMs, while maintaining compatibility with legacy option ROM images.

The UEFI Specification is designed keeping in mind the goal of having compact driver images. However to facilitate support for multiple processor architectures, a driver object file for each architecture is required to be included leading to a space issue. To resolve this issue, UEFI defines EFI Byte Code Virtual Machine. Every driver file is compiled into just a single EFI Byte Code object which is run by an UEFI Byte Code Interpreter included in the UEFI Specification complaint firmware. Another very common method to resolve this issue is compression. The UEFI specification defined compression and decompression algorithms which may be used to reduce the size of UEFI Drivers.

This information can used by OEMs, IHVs, OSVs, and firmware vendors for developing drivers that produce standard protocol interfaces, and operating system loaders that can be used to boot UEFI compliant operating systems.

\subsubsection{\gls{uefi}'s Role in boot process}

During the boot process, UEFI speaks to the operating system loader and acts as the interface between the operating system and the BIOS.

The \verb|PC-AT| boot environment is challenging to innovate as each new firmware capability requires firmware developers to craft more complex solutions, often requiring OS developers to make changes to their boot code. Since this is a time-consuming process and also required investment of resources, the UEFI specification undertakes it as a primary goal to overcome this issue.
